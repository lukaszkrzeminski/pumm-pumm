## A website of a sofa manufacturer. Think twice before you chose your sofa!
---
### Description 
This is a landing page project where I could refresh my knowledge of Vanilla JS, CSS styling and HTML tags.

### Technologies used:

- HTML
> Propper use of HTML Tags
- CSS
> Flexbox<br />
Grid <br />
Responsive Web Design <br />
BEM Methodology <br />
- SVG
- Javascript

### Work done
1. Template navigation menu
2. Smooth, minimalistic animations on buttons
3. Functionality to change sofa preview color
4. Infinite scrolling text
5. Template form
6. Template socials links

### What have I learned and reminded:
* Propper use of HTML Tags
* Naming classes according to the BEM technology
* Manipulating DOM elements using JS
* Using media queries to make the page look as good as possible on many different screens
* Using and changing properties of SVG files
* Ability to turn Figma project to a selfcoded landing page
* Creating smooth animations, especially how to make a scrolling text
* Propper arrangement of elements with the use of flexbox and grid

### Future work ideas:
1. Import and use different font to make the page look even better
2. Optimise size of SVG elements to make the page run smoother and load faster
3. Create an actual newsletter form
4. Get more content to bring to life the remaining subpages and links
5. Optimise and reforge the scrolling text functionality with the use of JS
6. Deliver a dark theme and theme toggler
